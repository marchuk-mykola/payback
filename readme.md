## Features

Image Explorer facilitates the retrieval of images from Pixabay based on user queries.
It showcases these images in a list format. The app also includes Room DB for local caching.
A detailed view of the image is available in the Details view, triggered by a user's positive interaction with a dialog prompt.

## Design and Architecture

My app adopts the Modular Clean Architecture with MVI presentation architecture. This design approach ensures a clear separation of concerns and simplifies testing.
Presentation -> Domain <- Data
